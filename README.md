Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the stock prices of Microsoft Corporation for the next 20-30 days. The model is based on stacked LSTMs and uses data from the Tiingo API.


Background

Stock price prediction is an important aspect of finance that helps investors make informed decisions about buying and selling stocks. In this project, we aim to predict the future stock prices of Microsoft Corporation using machine learning techniques. We use data from the Tiingo API to train a stacked LSTM model that can predict the stock prices for the next 20-30 days.


Usage

To use this project, you will need to obtain an API key from Tiingo. Once you have your API key, you can run the project by running the code.ipynb notebook.
jupyter notebook code.ipynb
The notebook contains detailed instructions on how to use the project, including how to train the model, predict stock prices, and visualize the results.
